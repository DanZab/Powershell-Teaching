# Powershell-Teaching
Educational Content for learning Powershell

I enjoy teaching Powershell and as I have worked with other people I have come to realize a couple things:

1. It is easier to teach people one thing at a time instead of throwing multiple concepts at them at once
2. I normally end up teaching the same concepts/components repeatedly

Based on these two facts, I wanted to build out a basic learning repo with different components that I could refer poeple back to.

I realize that all of this information can be found elsewhere, but this gives me a way to tailor content how I'd like.

## How to use this Repo
Each sub-directory here goes over different elements, each will contain a very simple, straightforward walkthrough along with examples.

It will also contain a Challenge section someone could download and work through along with an answer section.
